GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a revised version of the selected README file:

## About this script
This script is based on the original file available at https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/api_request_parallel_processor.py. It has been modified to include a proxy option, which can be specified in the `run_api_request_parallel_processor.sh` file.

## How to use
To use this script, you'll need to create a `jsonl` file similar to the `example_data.jsonl` file included in this repository. You can add metadata fields to this file as needed.

Next, customize the `run_api_request_parallel_processor.sh` file to suit your needs. Be sure to check your API limits and set the appropriate values for `max_tokens_per_minute` and `max_requests_per_minute`.

Once you've customized the script, you can run it to process your API requests.
